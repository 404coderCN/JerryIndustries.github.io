## About this site

During my 5+ years at Cornell, I've done some interesting projects and some other crazy stuff. I though it would be fun to share some of these experiences. 
I hope you'll enjoy them too.

On the technical side, I've completed multiple projects leveraging microcontrollers, such as Arduino nano, Raspberry Pi Pico, Raspberry Pi 4, and FPGAs, and other more software-oriented projects, such as GEMM quantization for NLP. The best part of these projects is the problem-solving process. Being able to brainstorm and try innovative solutions for problems with friends, then see the project come together piece by piece is such an invaluable experience. Of course, there were countless sleepless nights and constant frustrations trying to debug here or there, and not to mention I've gained more than 20 lbs. since freshman year (Stress eating? I'm not sure.). But looking back, all I can think of are the good memories. I was up at 2 AM trying to push an ASIC design through the flow, calibrating a robot car at 3AM in the Philips hallway, and rushed to the lab in my flip-flops at midnight to record the Cadence design for a VLSI lab. But I also saw shooting stars beside the planetarium, camped on the slope with my friend, saw sunsets that were purple, orange, and red, and no language of human could ever describe the magnificence of it, and saw sunrise with the girl who eventually(thank god) became my girlfriend. So much has happened here, and so much more has yet to come...

<!-- ## A Free Blogging Theme
**Hydejack** started out as a free blogging theme for Jekyll — and continues to be so.

<!--posts-->


<!-- ## An Impressive Portfolio
A portfolio that's guaranteed to be impressive — no matter what you put into it.

<!-- ## My Resume
This is my [resume](assets/img/blog/Resume_lightmatter.pdf), feel free to reach out if you're interested!
<!-- or [PDF](assets/Resume.pdf). -->

<!-- ## Just Markdown
Write all content with Markdown. __Hydejack__ gives you [additional CSS classes](docs/writing.md) to stylize your content, without losing compatibility with other Jekyll themes.


## Just Markup
**Hydejack** boasts a plethora of modern JavaScript, but make no mistake: It's still a _plain old web page_ at its core. It works without JavaScript and you can even view it in a text-based browser like `w3m`:

The Hydejack blog, as seen by the text browser `w3m`.

## Syntax Highlighting
**Hydejack** features syntax highlighting, powered by [Rouge].

```html
<!-- file: `_includes/my-body.html` -->
<!-- <script type="module">
  document.querySelector("hy-push-state").addEventListener("hy-push-state-load", () => {
    const supportsCodeHighlights = false; // TBD!!
  });
</script>
```

Code blocks can have a filename and a caption.

## Beautiful Math
They say math is beautiful — and with **Hydejack**'s [math support][math] it's guaranteed to also look beautiful:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \phi(x,y) &= \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right) \\[2em]
            &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j)            \\[2em]
            &= (x_1, \ldots, x_n)
               \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
                 \phi(e_1, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
                 \vdots          & \ddots & \vdots         \\
                 \phi(e_n, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
               \end{array}\right)
               \left(\begin{array}{c}
                 y_1    \\
                 \vdots \\
                 y_n
               \end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Hydejack uses KaTeX to efficiently render math.
